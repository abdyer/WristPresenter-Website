# Wrist Presenter for iPhone® and Android®, lets you control presentations wirelessly with your Pebble Smartwatch.

Houston, USA — February 1st 2014 — Today Matthew Morey and Andrew Dyer released Wrist Presenter for iPhone®, iPod touch®, and Android® devices. Wrist Presenter is a mobile app with a companion Pebble® smartwatch app that lets you control presentations wirelessly. Instead of purchasing an expensive wireless remote, users can use what they already have.

A quick glance at your Pebble and you will instantly know what slide you are on and how many slides you have left. Change slides by pressing the top or bottom button on the right side of the Pebble. Presentations can be easily loaded via iTunes USB File Sharing, from other iOS apps using the "Open In" menu, and Google Drive. Presentations can be viewed on a projector by mirroring your device via Airplay, with a Lightning adapter, or with Chromecast.
